1. Twig files are files where we mix HTML tags with dynamic data. Twig is a templating language.
We previously saw that these are rendered with the templating service inside a controller.
Twig has different tags
{{ }} = say something tag -> echo
{% %} = do something tag -> looping, defining variables and their statements.

Twigs components are divisible in 4 categories
Tags - do, if, for etc
Filters : with |, example date, reverse ect
Functions like block, max, min etc
Tests like: even, divisible by ect

We can decorate our twig template with the base.twig.layout.

The block tag are like holes which child templates fill in.
The content of the body block of index.html.twig is inserted into the body block of base.html.twig.
If we open the base.html.twig file, we see that the title block has a default hardcoded title: Welcome!
We can replace the title in our child templates: {% block title %} This is my custom title {% endblock %}
A shorter syntax for the title block: {% block title 'This is my custom title' %}

We can also append to a block instead of replacing it. This is done with parent() - see later

{% extends 'base.html.twig' %}
When we extend the base.html.twig file, we have actually extended the base.html.twig file in the Resources views folder of the app folder (no bundle, no subdirectory).
The file name inside a twig file is the same as what we use inside a controller
BundleName:Directory:filename => BundleName/Resources/views/Directory/filename
base.html.twig => ::base.html.twig => The bundle name is missing and it is not in a directory inside a Resources/views folder
=> The file is inside the app/Resources/views root folder,
