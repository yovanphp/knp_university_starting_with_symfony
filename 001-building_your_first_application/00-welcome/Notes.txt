1. Symfony is a component library. This means that we can use any part of it in any PHP project - even legacy apps.
We could use symfony's router component to give it flexible URLs.

- Finder: Listing and filtering (date, filename, etc) files and directories.
- Console: Awesome command-line applications with coloration, input/output & other goodies.
- Process: Excecute external processes, check errors, send signals, run asynchronously.
- Routing: Create a front controller (e.g index.php) and flexible URL structures in any app.

Other frameworks use parts of symfony like Drupal and Lavarel.

Symfony is also a framework - how every individual components can work together in a consistent framework.

Silex is another framework built on symfony. Its goal is to be tiny and really simple to use.
We can use both frameworks as they both use the same pieces.
Symfony follows widely used standards and hence works well with other librairies:
- Uses composer
- Follows PSR (code style, class naming, interfaces, etc) standards.

This makes it easy to use other librairies in our projects.
